# Chronic Kidney Disease Classification

Chronic kidney disease is one of the most common diseases facing humans, as well as one of the most dangerous. This disease is defined as a long-term condition in which the kidneys do not work as they should. It is a common condition often associated with aging. It can infect anyone, but it is more common in most countries such as those in South Asia. We come to the role that we have worked on now. Here in this project, we used data containing features for reasons that indicate chronic kidney disease. We played an important role in this, which is that we used machine learning algorithms to help classify the person with or without this disease. . Where the results we obtained showed that they are wonderful results, and the measurements proved that.
